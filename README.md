# Daily Code Wars

This repository is a collection of daily Code Wars challenges (Katas) done in JavaScript, mainly (but not limited to) the fundamentals category.

Each folder will have the date as its name and, inside, the JS file itself with a readme file describing the kata, the title, the Kyu (Dificulty level), and the appropriate tags.

(I put this repo as private as per CodeWars' request)
