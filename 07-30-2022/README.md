# Double Char (8 kyu)

Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.

Examples (Input -> Output):
```JavaScript
  * "String"      -> "SSttrriinngg"
  * "Hello World" -> "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd"
  * "1234!_ "     -> "11223344!!__  "
```
Good Luck!
